•Programming Exercises-

 1)To understand the value of records in a programming language, 
 write a small program in a C-based language that uses an array 
 of structs that store student information, including name, age,
 GPA as a float, and grade level as a string (e.g., “freshmen,” etc.).
 Also, write the same program in the same language without using structs.

2)To understand the value of recursion in a programming language, write 
a program that implements quicksort, first using recursion 
and then with- out recursion.
