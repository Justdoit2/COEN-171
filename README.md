COEN 171: Principles of Design and Implementation of Programming Languages

Course Objectives:
  -Explain reasons for studying different programming languages
  
  -Use different programming languages to prove that students can learn any programming language the company or changing times will require
  
  -Learn about possible problems probramming languages may habe because of their implementations
  
  -Compare different syntax and learn for which applications will oen or other be preferred
  
  
Learning Outcomes:

  -Construct algorithms in several programming languages across different programming language paradigms
  
  -Specify , infer, and use types in the type system of a programming language
  
  -Compare an contrast control structures and mechanisms such as iteration and recursion across different programming languages
  
   -Compare and contrast different parameter passing and evaluation strategies
   
   -Explain and use different name-value binding(i.e., scoping) implementations
